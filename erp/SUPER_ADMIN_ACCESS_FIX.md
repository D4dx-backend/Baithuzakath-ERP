# Super Admin Access Fix for Projects and Schemes

## Issue
Super admin users were unable to see projects and schemes in the system. The listing pages were empty even though data existed in the database.

## Root Cause
The backend controllers and models had regional access control logic that only checked for `state_admin` role, excluding `super_admin` from accessing all data.

## Files Modified

### 1. Project Controller (`baithuzkath-api/src/controllers/projectController.js`)
- **getProjects()**: Added super_admin check to bypass regional filtering
- **getProjectStats()**: Added super_admin check for statistics aggregation

### 2. Scheme Controller (`baithuzkath-api/src/controllers/schemeController.js`)
- **getSchemes()**: Added super_admin check to bypass regional filtering
- **getSchemeStats()**: Added super_admin check for statistics aggregation
- **getActiveSchemes()**: Added super_admin check for active schemes listing

### 3. Project Model (`baithuzkath-api/src/models/Project.js`)
- **canUserAccess()**: Added super_admin to roles that can access all projects

### 4. Scheme Model (`baithuzkath-api/src/models/Scheme.js`)
- **canUserAccess()**: Added super_admin to roles that can access all schemes

## Changes Made

### Before
```javascript
if (req.user.role !== 'state_admin') {
  const userRegions = req.user.adminScope.regions;
  filter.targetRegions = { $in: userRegions };
}
```

### After
```javascript
if (req.user.role !== 'super_admin' && req.user.role !== 'state_admin') {
  const userRegions = req.user.adminScope?.regions || [];
  if (userRegions.length > 0) {
    filter.targetRegions = { $in: userRegions };
  }
}
```

## Additional Improvements
- Added null-safe checks for `adminScope` properties using optional chaining (`?.`)
- Added validation to ensure regions array exists before filtering
- Improved error handling for users without proper scope configuration

## Testing
To verify the fix:

1. Restart the backend server:
```bash
cd baithuzkath-api
npm restart
```

2. Login as super_admin and navigate to:
   - `/projects` - Should show all projects
   - `/schemes` - Should show all schemes

3. Verify that:
   - All projects are visible regardless of target regions
   - All schemes are visible regardless of target regions
   - Create, edit, and delete operations work correctly
   - Individual project/scheme details can be accessed

## Impact
- **Super Admin**: Now has full access to all projects and schemes
- **State Admin**: No change, continues to have full access
- **Other Admins**: No change, continues to see only regional data

## RBAC Compliance
This fix aligns with the RBAC system where:
- Level 0 (super_admin): Has unrestricted access to all system data
- Level 1 (state_admin): Has access to all state-level data
- Level 2+ (district_admin, area_admin, etc.): Have regional access based on adminScope
