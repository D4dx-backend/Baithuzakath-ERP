```
URL: http://localhost:8081/beneficiary/track/APP2025000001
- Replace APP2025000001 with your actual application ID
- View complete application details and timeline
- Use refresh button to check for status updates
```

### 4. **Alternative Access Methods**
- From Dashboard: Use "Track Application" search box
- From Application List: Click "View Details" on any application
- Direct URL: Navigate to `/beneficiary/track/:applicationId`

## Backend Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Verify JWT token and extract user info
2. **Application Lookup**: Find application by applicationNumber
3. **Ownership Verification**: Ensure user owns the application
4. **Data Population**: Include scheme and beneficiary details
5. **Response Formatting**: Return structured application data

## Frontend Data Flow

1. **Route Parameter**: Extract applicationId from URL
2. **API Call**: Fetch application data using beneficiaryApi.trackApplication()
3. **Timeline Generation**: Create dynamic timeline based on status
4. **UI Rendering**: Display application details and timeline
5. **User Actions**: Provide navigation and refresh options

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios:
- **Application Not Found**: Invalid or non-existent application ID
