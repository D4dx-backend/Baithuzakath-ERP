## Commit Log: Upload ERP folder

Date: 2025-10-30

Summary:
- Added the entire `erp/` application folder to version control.
- Includes frontend source (`src/`), configuration, build setup, and public assets.

Key contents included:
- `src/` with components, pages, hooks, contexts, services, and utilities
- `public/` assets and `index.html`
- Tooling: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, `eslint.config.js`
- Package manifests: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- Documentation and implementation guides under project root

Notes:
- Scoped staging to `erp/` and this log file to avoid committing unrelated changes (e.g., `.DS_Store`).
